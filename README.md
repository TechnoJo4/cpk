work in (slow) progress

on style: it's not atw-style, but there are some macros to make working in c more bearable.

### nyi

lambda adverbs vars refcount alloc

parse: string symbol compose m-expr

verbs: basically everything (see ref sheet above or doc/verbs.txt)

compiler: fun list >2-arity

misc todo: switch to a better build system, rewrite print
